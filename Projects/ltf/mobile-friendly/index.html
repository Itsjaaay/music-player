            <tr>
                <td>“Lucid Dreams”</td>
                <td>“Lucid Dreams” is a gut-wrenching tale of love gone wrong. The song is filled with memorable imagery
                    and details about a woman who used to love Juice Wrld. The song is so sad it might be painful to
                    listen to if not for the use of a guitar riff from Sting’s hit “Shape of My Heart.”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>“Bandit”</td>
                <td>At his best, Juice Wrld was an innovator. However, that doesn’t mean he wasn’t willing to fall back
                    on hip-hop tropes. “Bandit” is a conventional rap song about partying and women. It would fit snugly
                    into an album by the likes of Lil Wayne or ASAP Rocky.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>“Fine China”</td>
                <td>Here is a song that would have been notable based on its star power alone. “Fine China” is a
                    collaboration between Juice Wrld and Future, two of the defining rappers of their generation. The
                    song’s melodic trap beat is memorable.</td>
