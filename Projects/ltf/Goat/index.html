          <td>
            “Lucid Dreams” is a gut-wrenching tale of love gone wrong. The song
            is filled with memorable imagery and details about a woman who used
            to love Juice Wrld. The song is so sad it might be painful to listen
            to if not for the use of a guitar riff from Sting’s hit “Shape of My
            Heart.”
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>“Bandit”</td>
          <td>
            At his best, Juice Wrld was an innovator. However, that doesn’t mean
            he wasn’t willing to fall back on hip-hop tropes. “Bandit” is a
            conventional rap song about partying and women. It would fit snugly
            into an album by the likes of Lil Wayne or ASAP Rocky.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>“Fine China”</td>
          <td>
            Here is a song that would have been notable based on its star power
            alone. “Fine China” is a collaboration between Juice Wrld and
            Future, two of the defining rappers of their generation. The song’s
            melodic trap beat is memorable.
